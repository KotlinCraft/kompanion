## Overview

Kompanion is an intelligent coding assistant that helps you generate, improve, and understand Kotlin code. It uses a multi-step reasoning approach to:

1. Understand your requirements and existing codebase
2. Generate appropriate solutions
3. Iteratively refine code based on constraints and feedback
4. Provide clear explanations of its approach

## Features

- **Interactive Chat Interface** - A dynamic chat UI supporting multiple modes:
    - **Code Mode:** For code-related queries and generation.
    - **Ask Mode:** For general inquiries and explanations.
- **Slash Commands** - Quickly switch modes and invoke commands (e.g., `/code`, `/ask`, `/help`, `/clear`).
- **Auto-Scrolling** - The chat automatically scrolls to reveal new messages.
- **Working Directory Selector** - Update your working directory via a file selector with changes saved to your configuration.
- **Settings Dialog** - Easily update configuration settings (like your OpenAI API key) through an intuitive dialog.
