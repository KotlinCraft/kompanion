# Kompanion

AI-powered code assistant that iteratively generates and improves Kotlin code through reasoning and feedback loops.

## ðŸš§ Coming Soon ðŸš§

Kompanion is currently under active development. Stay tuned for the first release!

## Overview

Kompanion is an intelligent coding assistant that helps you generate, improve, and understand Kotlin code. It uses a multi-step reasoning approach to:

1. Understand your requirements and existing codebase
2. Generate appropriate solutions
3. Iteratively refine code based on constraints and feedback
4. Provide clear explanations of its approach

## Features

- **Iterative Improvement** - Progressive refinement of generated code
- **Context-Aware** - Understands your existing codebase
- **Reasoning-Based** - Explains its approach and decision making
- **Kotlin-First** - Optimized for Kotlin development workflows

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- JDK 11 or higher
- Kotlin 1.7+
- Gradle 7.0+

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/kompanion.git
cd kompanion
./gradlew build
```

### Running Kompanion

```bash
./gradlew run
```

## Usage

Once launched, Kompanion provides a chat interface where you can:

1. Request code generation based on requirements
2. Upload existing code files for context
3. Provide feedback to improve results
4. View explanations of generated code

Example interactions coming soon!

## Architecture

Kompanion is built on a modular architecture with:

- Reasoning Engine - For understanding requirements and planning solutions
- Code Generation - For producing and refining Kotlin code
- Context Management - For maintaining awareness of your codebase
- Feedback System - For continuous improvement
